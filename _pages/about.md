I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at the Interinstitutional Graduate Program in Statistics ([PIPGEs UFSCar–USP](https://www.pipges.ufscar.br)), a joint program between the Federal University of São Carlos and the University of São Paulo, Brazil. I am advised by Prof. [Rafael Izbicki](https://rafaelizbicki.com/) and Prof. [Rafael B. Stern](https://www.rafaelstern.science/). I hold a Bachelor's degree in Statistics from the Federal University of São Carlos (2022).

My research interests lie in Uncertainty Quantification in Machine Learning, Statistical Learning, and Nonparametric Inference — with a particular focus on Conformal Prediction, Likelihood-Free Inference (Simulation-Based Inference), and Hypothesis Testing.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
