I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at the [Interinstitutional Graduate Program in Statistics (PIPGEs UFSCar–USP)](https://www.pipges.ufscar.br), a collaborative program between the Federal University of São Carlos and the University of São Paulo, Brazil. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Rafael Izbicki](https://rafaelizbicki.com/) and [Prof. Rafael B. Stern](https://www.rafaelstern.science/), and to be part of the [Statistical Machine Learning Lab (SMaLL - UFSCar)](https://small-research.github.io/website/). I earned my Bachelor's degree in Statistics from the Federal University of São Carlos in 2022.

My research interests center around Uncertainty Quantification in Machine Learning, Statistical Learning, and Nonparametric Inference — with a particular emphasis on Conformal Prediction, Likelihood-Free Inference (also known as Simulation-Based Inference), and Hypothesis Testing. Lately, I have been especially interested in the intersection between Conformal Prediction and modern Statistical Inference, particularly in the context of likelihood-free methods.

Outside of research, I enjoy reading books and mangás, going to the gym, and having long, curious conversations with friends.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
